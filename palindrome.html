        This HTML is for T07 - Control Structures - For and While Loops - Practical Task 2.
        The associated JavaScript code will need to ask the user to input a word and check 
        to see if that word is a palindrome in which case it outputs a message to the user 
        to confirm they entered a palindrome !
