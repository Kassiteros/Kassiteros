<h6 style:font-size:21px>I rescued a kitten from Corfu last summer. He befriended us and we fed him and saw him improve with just a few days care. Like other feral cats he was bin diving to keep alive. My girlfriend named him Tin Ribs. When we needed a name for his passport, I decided on Kassiteros, the Greek for Tin ! It took a lot of effort and planning to get Kass back from Corfu. I made sure I had pictures to identify the little critter and talked to the local cat friendly shop keeper, a cattery, and ensured I had a local "support network". We were only there for a few days so not enough time to get him vaccinated, passported and chipped. It was difficult, I got Kass "collected", connected with a couple bringing their cat to the UK and they eventually brought Kass back with them. I did it, I did that, I made it happen !!! Kass has now grown a thick healthy fur that covers all my clothes ðŸ˜œ He doesn't chase his food bowl around the room, he knows there will be more. He's a very loving cat and sleeps on my arm when I am working on my laptop and on my head at nightðŸ˜†</h6>

<h6>Why am I telling you this ? Because it motivated me. It took a lot of effort and perseverance to organise for Kass to be safely brought home. I thought that if I can make that happen with planning, networking and sheer determination, then I can do the same for myself. I have been a primary school teacher and worked through the IT industry starting as a programmer and received a varied, "shop floor" view of the IT industry. I worked with the IBM i-Series and learnt a lot about a "machine platform" and how to support it and use it to support applications and I learnt how these applications depend, adapt and capitalise on the strengths of that platform and depend on the underpinning databases. At the moment I am in an IT management role but feeling the "call of the wild", a desire to get back to my technical roots. When I started out, programming was a 9 to 5, lowly job on the corporate ladder. That has changed dramatically. I want a career change that allows me to get back into to the programming I enjoyed so much. I want to enjoy the benefits that now accompany many programming roles of contract and flexible working. Bringing Kassi back made me confident that with some effort I can achieve the changes I want and a more challenging and fulfilling career more closely attuned to my lifestyle. I was accepted onto a Hyperiondev bootcamp in full stack web development and now I am building the toolkit to make my dreams a reality !</h6>
