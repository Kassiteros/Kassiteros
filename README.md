<h5>I rescued a kitten from Korfu last summer. He befriended us and we fed him and saw him improve with just a few days care. Like other feral cats he was bin diving to keep alive. My girlfriend named him Tin Ribs. When we needed a name for his passport I decided on **_Kassiteros_** the Greek for Tin ! It took a lot of effort and planning to get Kass from Korfu to the UK. I made sure I had pictures to identify the little critter and talked to the local cat friendly shop keeper, a cattery and ensured I had a local "support network". We were only there for a few days so not enough time to get him passported and chipped. It was difficult and there was some reticense to help but I connected with a couple bringing their cat to the UK and they eventually brought Kass with them back to the UK. **I did it !!!** Kass has now grown a thick healthy fur, that covers all my clothes. He doesn't chase his food bowl around the room, knows there will be more. He's a very loving cat and sleeps on my arm when I am working on my laptop and on my head at nightðŸ˜†</h5>

Why am I telling you this ? Because it motivated me. It took a lot of effrot AND perseverance to organise from the UK for Kass to be collected, passported and brought home. I thought that if I can do that, if I can _"make it happen"_, I can do the same for myself. I started life as a programmer, I have been in the classroom and worked in the IT industry for sometime. I worked with the IBM i-Series and learnt a lot about a "machine platform" and how to use it to support applications and how thise applications depended on it and the databases it served. At the moment I am in a management role but feeling the "call of the wild", a desire to get back to my technical roots. I want a career change that allows me to get back into th programming I enjoyed and to work more flexibly, more around my life and my cat ðŸ˜œ Bringing Kassi back made me confident that with some effort I could achieve the changes I wanted and a more challenging and fullfilling career. I was accepted onto a Hyperiondev bootcamp in full stack web development and now I am developing the toolkit to make my dreams happen too !!
