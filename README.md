<h6 style:font-size:21px>I rescued a kitten from Korfu last summer. He befriended us and we fed him and saw him improve with just a few days care. Like other feral cats he was bin diving to keep alive. My girlfriend named him Tin Ribs. When we needed a name for his passport, I decided on **_Kassiteros_** the Greek for Tin ! It took a lot of effort and planning to get Kass back from Corfu. I made sure I had pictures to identify the little critter and talked to the local cat friendly shop keeper, a cattery and ensured I had a local "support network". We were only there for a few days so not enough time to get him passported and chipped. It was difficult, I connected with a couple bringing their cat to the UK and they eventually brought Kass back with them. **I did it !!!** Kass has now grown a thick healthy fur, that covers all my clothes. He doesn't chase his food bowl around the room, he knows there will be more. He's a very loving cat and sleeps on my arm when I am working on my laptop and on my head at nightðŸ˜†</h6>

<h6>Why am I telling you this ? Because it motivated me. It took a lot of effort AND perseverance to organise from the UK for Kass to be collected, passported and safely brought home. I thought that if I can make that happen with planing, networking and sheer determination, then I can do the same for myself. I have been a teacher and worked through the IT industry starting as a programmer and through fate and job oportunities received a widely varied shop floor view of the IT industry. I worked with the IBM i-Series and learnt a lot about a "machine platform" and how to support it and use it to support applications and I learnt how these applications depended, adapt and capitalise on the strengths of that platform and I learnt about the underpinning that databases provide. At the moment I am in a management role but feeling the "call of the wild", a desire to get back to my technical roots. When I started out programming was a 9 -5 and lowly job on the corporate ladder. I want a career change that allows me to get back into to programming I enjoyed and to enjoy the benefits that now surround programmuing jobs of working more flexibly, more around my life and my cat ðŸ˜œ Bringing Kassi back made me confident that with some effort I could achieve the changes I wanted and a more challenging and fullfilling career. I was accepted onto a Hyperiondev bootcamp in full stack web development and now I am developing the toolkit to make my dreams happen too !!</h6>
