I rescued a kitten from Korfu last summer. He befriended us and we fed him and saw him improve with just a few days care. Like other feral cats he was bin diving to keep alive. My girlfriend named him Tin Ribs. When we needed a name for his passport I decided on **_Kassiteros_** the Greek for Tin ! It took a lot of effort and planning to get Kass from Korfu to the UK. I made sure I had pictures to identify the little critter and talked to the local cat friendly shop keeper, a cattery and ensured I had a local "support network". We were only there for a few days so not enough time to get him passported and chipped. It was difficult and there was some reticense to help from the owner of the holiday venue we stayed at but I did it !!! I connected with a couple bringing their cat to the UK and they brought Kass with them, flight to Brussels then Eurotunnel to UK. Kass has now grown a thick healthy fur, that covers all my clothes. He doesn't chase his food bowl around the room, he knows there will be more food. He is a very loving cat and sleeps on my head at nightðŸ˜†

Why am I telling you this ? Because it motivated me. It took a lot of effrot AND perseverance to organise for Kass to be collected, passported and brought back to the UK. I thought that if I can do that, if I can "make it happen", make things happen, I can do the same for myself. I started life as a programmer and was a good one but didn't have long enough before fate and jobs took me off in other directions. I have been in the classroom and worked in the IT industry for sometime. I worked with the IBM i-Series and learnt a lot about a "machine platform" and how to use it to support applications and how thise applications depended on it and the databases it served. At the moment I am in a management role but feeling the "call of the wild", a desire to get back to my technical roots. I want a career change that allows me to get back into th programming I enjoyed and to work more flexibly, more around my life and my cat ðŸ˜œ Bringing Kassi back made me confident that with some effort I could achieve the changes I wanted and a more challenging and fullfilling career. I was accepted onto a Hyperiondev bootcamp in full stack web development and now I am developing the toolkit to make my dreams happen too !!
